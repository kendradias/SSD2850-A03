1. How to create animated text for the top highlighted section on page load?
ChatGPT Answer:
To create animated text for the top highlighted section on page load, you can use a typing animation effect. 
The text should appear letter by letter, creating the illusion of it being typed. 
This can be achieved with CSS animations or JavaScript functions that manipulate the text content in a timed manner. 
The text can be animated with a "blink" effect at the end to resemble a typing cursor.

2. How to create an animated border on hover?
ChatGPT Answer:
To create an animated border on hover, you would typically use CSS with pseudo-elements (::before or ::after) to create the border and apply a transition effect. 
The border should appear or change its properties when the user hovers over an element, such as changing its opacity, width, or color. 
This effect is typically smooth, with the border gradually appearing or expanding when the hover state is triggered.

3. Why does the border disappear on hover when the image is covering it?
ChatGPT Answer:
The issue of the border disappearing when hovering over the image occurs because the image itself is typically positioned within a container that might have overflow: hidden or similar properties. 
When the image is set to cover (using object-fit: cover), it may stretch to fill the container, potentially covering the border, especially if the image is larger than the container's dimensions.

4. Why does the border disappear on hover?
ChatGPT Answer:
The border may disappear on hover if there's a conflicting CSS rule that hides or alters the border when the element is hovered over, such as setting border: none; or changing the border color to transparent. To fix this, ensure that the border property is not altered by any hover effects unless intended.

5. Suggestions to add content in the top highlight section?
ChatGPT Answer:
Display important updates, announcements, or promotions (e.g., new blog posts, upcoming events, or product launches) that visitors should notice immediately.

6. How to set a gradient background that transitions from one color to another?
ChatGPT Answer:
To set a gradient background that transitions from one color to another, you can use the background or background-image property in CSS, combined with a gradient function like linear-gradient or radial-gradient.
In addition to basic gradients, you can also use a Webkit mask to apply gradient effects on an element's visibility or shape. 
The -webkit-mask-image property allows you to mask an element's content using a gradient, controlling which areas of the element are visible or transparent.

7. Why Use -webkit-mask and mask-composite?
ChatGPT Answer:
The use of -webkit-mask (with the linear-gradient) and mask-composite allows you to create intricate, layered masking effects that can reveal parts of an element in creative ways, such as revealing gradients or shapes while keeping the content beneath the mask intact. 
These properties provide advanced control over how the content and background interact in terms of visibility, blending, and transitions.

8. How can I give each letter in the heading a different color?
ChatGPT Answer:
To give each letter in a heading a different color, you can wrap each letter in a <span> tag and apply individual styles to each span. Here’s how you can do it:

Your HTML and CSS for the navbar and footer look solid, and the layout is well-structured! However, there are some opportunities to optimize and improve best practices, remove redundancies, and ensure better maintainability:

Feedback on HTML
Accessibility:

Add aria-label or alt attributes for better accessibility. For example, the <nav> tag could have an aria-label (e.g., aria-label="Main navigation" for the header and aria-label="Footer navigation" for the footer).
Ensure alt attributes for images describe their purpose meaningfully (e.g., "Facebook icon" for the social media links).
Semantic HTML:

Use <ul> only for lists of related items. The "Menu" heading in the footer could be replaced with a <h4> or <p> with the class menu-title instead of being a list item.
Redundant Attributes:

The <meta charset> and <meta name="viewport"> are great, but ensure they appear first in the <head> to adhere to modern HTML best practices.
Footer Social Icons:

For the href values, consider adding target="_blank" and rel="noopener noreferrer" to ensure the links open in a new tab securely.
Feedback on CSS
General Best Practices:

Combine similar rules: Avoid duplicating properties. For example, border: none; and outline: none; in .search-input could be consolidated.
Use shorter shorthand properties where possible. For example:
css
Copy code
padding: 15px 40px 15px 15px; /* could become */
padding: 15px 40px 15px;
Variable Usage:

Your variables are great, but consider defining more variables for consistent spacing, font sizes, or breakpoints (e.g., --gap-small, --breakpoint-tablet).
Simplify Media Query Rules:

Instead of targeting each property individually, group similar selectors. For example:
css
Copy code
.nav-links, .nav-links li {
    text-align: center;
}
Reduce Redundancies:

The .menu-item + .menu-item rule for adding borders between items is clever, but it may not apply consistently if the footer structure changes. Consider adding a dedicated class for styling borders:
css
Copy code
.menu-item:not(:first-child) {
    border: 1px solid var(--white);
}
Hover Animations:

Avoid overusing heavy transformations like scaling in animations. Although your hover effect on .social-icon is great, too many similar animations on one page may affect performance. Instead, consider simple opacity or background-color transitions for subtle effects.
Responsive Design:

Your media queries are effective, but adding a few more for smaller breakpoints (e.g., 480px or below) would further improve usability on smaller mobile screens.
For example, at very small sizes, consider:
css
Copy code
.social-icons {
    flex-direction: column;
    gap: 0.5rem;
}
Specific Improvements:

The opacity: 0; visibility: hidden; transition on .nav-links is great, but you may want to set display: none in the hidden state for a more robust experience (to ensure they aren’t focusable when inactive).
Consistent Units:

Use consistent units (rem is better than px for scalability). For instance:
css
Copy code
.social-icon {
    width: 3rem;
    height: 3rem;
}
Suggestions for Improved Maintainability
Custom Classes for States:

Instead of toggling active on .nav-links or .hamburger-menu, consider using BEM methodology or a class like is-active. This helps maintain cleaner and more consistent code.
CSS Organization:

Consider grouping related rules together. For instance, place all .footer-nav styles in one block instead of scattering them across the file.
Use Comment Blocks:

You’ve already included some comments (great job!), but consider using consistent comment blocks to indicate major sections (e.g., navigation, footer, etc.).
JavaScript Enhancements:

If not done already, ensure that toggling .active on .hamburger-menu is linked to toggling .nav-links.active for better user interaction.
Example CSS Cleanup
Here's a cleaned-up version of one section as an example:

css
Copy code
/* Footer Navigation */
.footer-nav {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-around;
    align-items: center;
    padding: 1rem 0;
}

.footer-menu {
    list-style: none;
    padding: 0;
    margin: 0;
}

.footer-menu li {
    padding: 0.5rem;
}

.footer-link {
    text-decoration: none;
    color: var(--white);
    transition: color 0.3s ease;
}

.footer-link:hover {
    color: var(--lime-green);
}

[data-role="footer-menu-title"] {
    text-transform: uppercase;
    font-weight: bold;
    color: var(--lime-green);
    cursor: pointer;
}

.social-icons {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    gap: 1rem;
    margin-bottom: 1rem;
}

.social-icon img {
    width: 3rem;
    height: 3rem;
    object-fit: cover;
    transition: transform 0.3s ease;
}

.social-icon:hover {
    transform: scale(1.2);
}
Summary of Improvements
Add accessibility enhancements (aria-label, better alt attributes).
Simplify and consolidate similar CSS rules.
Use consistent units (rem over px) for better scalability.
Improve media queries for smaller screen sizes.
Consider semantic alternatives for ul where unnecessary.
These changes will ensure better performance, accessibility, and maintainability. Let me know if you need further assistance!

Your HTML and CSS for the navbar and footer look solid, and the layout is well-structured! However, there are some opportunities to optimize and improve best practices, remove redundancies, and ensure better maintainability:

Feedback on HTML
Accessibility:

Add aria-label or alt attributes for better accessibility. For example, the <nav> tag could have an aria-label (e.g., aria-label="Main navigation" for the header and aria-label="Footer navigation" for the footer).
Ensure alt attributes for images describe their purpose meaningfully (e.g., "Facebook icon" for the social media links).
Semantic HTML:

Use <ul> only for lists of related items. The "Menu" heading in the footer could be replaced with a <h4> or <p> with the class menu-title instead of being a list item.
Redundant Attributes:

The <meta charset> and <meta name="viewport"> are great, but ensure they appear first in the <head> to adhere to modern HTML best practices.
Footer Social Icons:

For the href values, consider adding target="_blank" and rel="noopener noreferrer" to ensure the links open in a new tab securely.
Feedback on CSS
General Best Practices:

Combine similar rules: Avoid duplicating properties. For example, border: none; and outline: none; in .search-input could be consolidated.
Use shorter shorthand properties where possible. For example:
css
Copy code
padding: 15px 40px 15px 15px; /* could become */
padding: 15px 40px 15px;
Variable Usage:

Your variables are great, but consider defining more variables for consistent spacing, font sizes, or breakpoints (e.g., --gap-small, --breakpoint-tablet).
Simplify Media Query Rules:

Instead of targeting each property individually, group similar selectors. For example:
css
Copy code
.nav-links, .nav-links li {
    text-align: center;
}
Reduce Redundancies:

The .menu-item + .menu-item rule for adding borders between items is clever, but it may not apply consistently if the footer structure changes. Consider adding a dedicated class for styling borders:
css
Copy code
.menu-item:not(:first-child) {
    border: 1px solid var(--white);
}
Hover Animations:

Avoid overusing heavy transformations like scaling in animations. Although your hover effect on .social-icon is great, too many similar animations on one page may affect performance. Instead, consider simple opacity or background-color transitions for subtle effects.
Responsive Design:

Your media queries are effective, but adding a few more for smaller breakpoints (e.g., 480px or below) would further improve usability on smaller mobile screens.
For example, at very small sizes, consider:
css
Copy code
.social-icons {
    flex-direction: column;
    gap: 0.5rem;
}
Specific Improvements:

The opacity: 0; visibility: hidden; transition on .nav-links is great, but you may want to set display: none in the hidden state for a more robust experience (to ensure they aren’t focusable when inactive).
Consistent Units:

Use consistent units (rem is better than px for scalability). For instance:
css
Copy code
.social-icon {
    width: 3rem;
    height: 3rem;
}
Suggestions for Improved Maintainability
Custom Classes for States:

Instead of toggling active on .nav-links or .hamburger-menu, consider using BEM methodology or a class like is-active. This helps maintain cleaner and more consistent code.
CSS Organization:

Consider grouping related rules together. For instance, place all .footer-nav styles in one block instead of scattering them across the file.
Use Comment Blocks:

You’ve already included some comments (great job!), but consider using consistent comment blocks to indicate major sections (e.g., navigation, footer, etc.).
JavaScript Enhancements:

If not done already, ensure that toggling .active on .hamburger-menu is linked to toggling .nav-links.active for better user interaction.
Example CSS Cleanup
Here's a cleaned-up version of one section as an example:

css
Copy code
/* Footer Navigation */
.footer-nav {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-around;
    align-items: center;
    padding: 1rem 0;
}

.footer-menu {
    list-style: none;
    padding: 0;
    margin: 0;
}

.footer-menu li {
    padding: 0.5rem;
}

.footer-link {
    text-decoration: none;
    color: var(--white);
    transition: color 0.3s ease;
}

.footer-link:hover {
    color: var(--lime-green);
}

[data-role="footer-menu-title"] {
    text-transform: uppercase;
    font-weight: bold;
    color: var(--lime-green);
    cursor: pointer;
}

.social-icons {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    gap: 1rem;
    margin-bottom: 1rem;
}

.social-icon img {
    width: 3rem;
    height: 3rem;
    object-fit: cover;
    transition: transform 0.3s ease;
}

.social-icon:hover {
    transform: scale(1.2);
}
Summary of Improvements
Add accessibility enhancements (aria-label, better alt attributes).
Simplify and consolidate similar CSS rules.
Use consistent units (rem over px) for better scalability.
Improve media queries for smaller screen sizes.
Consider semantic alternatives for ul where unnecessary.
